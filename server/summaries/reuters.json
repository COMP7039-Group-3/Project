        "title": "Powell's 'half-full' U.S. glass sturdy but still at risk for spills as Fed meets",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has taken a glass-half-full view of the U.S. economy but the trouble may be that the glass has gotten smaller and has a few cracks. \nOver the next week it risks losing a few drops as deadlines approach for the United States to impose new tariffs on China, British voters decide what has been called a \u201cnightmare\u201d election between far-left and far-right candidates, and other central banks take stock of what seems an increasingly turgid global economy. \nPowell offered the upbeat assessment two weeks ago at a speech in Rhode Island. James McCann, senior global economist with Aberdeen Standard Investments, said the metaphor is apt, given the resilience of the U.S. labor market, but only to a point. \n\u201cOur broad view is that the global economy has a lower speed limit that is setting in,\u201d and which may constrain the United States even if the trade war eases, he said.  \n\u201cEven in emerging markets the speed limit is slowing,\u201d with China and other large developing countries no longer the dependable props for global demand they were at the end of the 2007 to 2009 economic crisis. \nThe Federal Reserve meets this week and is likely to leave interest rates unchanged after cutting them three times this year. Policymakers on Wednesday will also provide updated projections for the U.S. economy and interest rates, their clearest statement yet of whether they think the rate cuts approved so far are enough to keep the economy rolling for another year. \nIn their last set of projections in September, policymakers at the median saw the U.S. economy growing 2% next year, roughly at trend, and officials have noted that markets that are sensitive to interest rates, such as housing and autos, have strengthened.  \nIn October, at his last press conference, Powell spoke of     \u201cthe makings of a possible settlement\u201d in the United State\u2019s trade dispute with China. Other sources of trouble, such as the possibility of a disruptive \u201chard\u201d departure of Britain from the European Union, also seemed less threatening. \nEconomic analysts looking ahead to next year also have been generally optimistic that 2019 will be seen as the year when growth and trade risks became their most acute, with the likelihood of a U.S. recession now easing. \nBut the global economy is slowing. The International Monetary Fund at its semi-annual meeting in October cut its world growth forecasts for this year and next and said the outlook remained \u201cprecarious.\u201d \n And there\u2019s still no deal between the United States and China. While U.S. import levies due to take effect on Dec. 15 now appear likely to be postponed, they are not expected to be canceled outright - pushing that set of risks off into 2020. The next round of tariffs is to include many consumer products that have been excluded from the import tax so far to try to limit price rises at the shopping mall. \nOn the upside, however, it appears a long-elusive deal to overhaul the NAFTA trade pact is now in reach, with an agreement struck Tuesday and lawmakers in the United States, Mexico and Canada all poised to ratify. \nYet, as with the up-and-down negotiations over Brexit - still unresolved and with the country\u2019s political leadership now up for grabs - the weeks since Powell\u2019s last press conference have shown how shaky any forecast may be that depends on elected officials to lower \u201cpolitical risk.\u201d  \nUncertainty over trade policy was a key reason the Fed cut rates this year, worried that businesses were scaling back investment plans to such a degree it could slow the economy overall unless the central bank took steps to counter it. \nSince then, negotiations have dragged on, and in addition Trump announced plans for new tariffs on metals from Argentina and Brazil, and threatened them on an array of French products.  \nIn Japan, the outlook has taken such a turn that the government rolled out a $120 billion fiscal stimulus program, justified by both the short-term damage from the trade war and a generically weak outlook for 2020.    \nPerhaps the biggest risk is that China\u2019s economy will slow regardless of what happens in the trade spat with the United States, as Chinese officials try to slash the country\u2019s debts to more sustainable levels and spending falls as a result.  \n\u201cWe\u2019ll likely see overseas growth stagnate for most of 2020,\u201d said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Japan\u2019s Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. \nOther central banks have been acting to try to counter concerns of a sort of creeping stagnation. \nLast week\u2019s surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report bolstered the case that the United States was so far immune from much of what may ail the world - be it Europe\u2019s endemic slow growth to the fallout of the very trade war that the United States initiated.  \nBut BNP Paribas Chief Economist Daniel Ahn says it is a short step from a worse-than-expected trade outcome or a bit of bad economic data to the sort of stock market volatility that ends up hurting the broader economy when household wealth takes a hit. \nAhn said he is already expecting monthly U.S. job growth to slow next year and dip below 100,000, a level Fed officials often cite as the breakeven between a labor market absorbing new job market entrants and one that is effectively sidelining people who want to work. \nThat could also hurt consumption, the economy\u2019s key prop at this point, and keep U.S. growth stuck at around 1% through early next year, Ahn said. It would be the sort of \u201cmaterial change\u201d in the economic outlook that Powell has said might prompt more rate cuts. BNP is expecting two cuts early next year. \n\u201cSentiment may have gotten a little bit ahead of itself,\u201d Ahn said of the broad consensus that the United States and China were poised for a trade breakthrough, a conclusion partly based on the notion that President Donald Trump will want the issue resolved at some point during an election year. \u201cWe think markets should be not quite as sanguine.\u201d   \nReporting by Howard Schneider; Additional reporting by Leika Kihara in Tokyo; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n",

        "title": "Trump's Dec. 15 China tariffs threaten a long list of Christmas favorites",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has days to decide whether to impose tariffs on nearly $160 billion in Chinese consumer goods just weeks before Christmas, a move that could be unwelcome in both the United States and China.  \nThe White House\u2019s top economic and trade advisers, including Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Larry Kudlow, Peter Navarro, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are expected to meet in coming days with Trump over that decision, one person briefed on the situation said. There is still no clarity on what the decision will be.  \n\u201cThey may very well go into effect. They may very well hold back. And the president\u2019s going to decide,\u201d the source said Monday afternoon.  \nThe way the tariffs are written, the Trump administration has to act, or else they automatically go into effect, trade experts said.  \n\u201cUnless USTR (the U.S. Trade Representative) issues a notice of modification for these tariffs, they will take effect on December 15 as scheduled,\u201d said Tami Overby, senior director at McLarty Associates, a Washington-based trade consultant.  \nKudlow, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said late Tuesday morning no decision had been made. \n\u201cThe reality is those tariffs are still on the table, the Dec. 15 tariffs, and the president has indicated if the short strokes remaining in negotiations do not pan out to his liking that those tariffs could go back into place,\u201d Kudlow said at a Wall Street Journal conference.  \nThe Trump administration said in August it would put 15% tariffs on billions in Chinese-made consumer goods on Dec. 15. Known as the \"4B\" list of goods here those tariffs would hit video game consoles, computer monitors, Christmas decorations, toys and other items including clothing often given as gifts. \nThe White House has been deliberating for weeks whether or not to impose the tariffs, and said here in early November they would likely be averted if a Phase One deal was reached.  \nBoth sides have still not reached agreement on crucial parts of the deal. These include the amount of U.S. agricultural goods Beijing would agree to purchase and when the U.S. would roll back other tariffs it imposed on Chinese goods, people briefed on the talks said. \n If the White House does allow the Dec. 15 tariffs to take effect, then the U.S.-China deal talks are likely done for the remainder of President Trump\u2019s term, the source said.  \nIn November, the Trump administration failed to meet its own deadline to impose tariffs on auto imports under a \u201cSection 232\u201d investigation. The White House needs to find another way to tax foreign cars after letting that deadline lapse, trade experts told Reuters. \nGoods that would be affected by the Dec. 15 tariffs include industrial goods like pesticides and other chemicals, but also a bevy of consumer items that are in heavy demand around the Christmas and New Years holidays, according to a Reuters analysis of the tariff list announced in August. They include plastic tableware, handbags, photo albums, woolen bathrobes, silk pajamas, turntables and jeweled wristwatches. \nWhile most goods that Americans will buy before Christmas had been shipped long before, retailers could add opportunistic price increases, trade experts said.   \n\u201cTrump does not want to do that right before Christmas. The optics would be terrible,\u201d William Reinsch, a former senior U.S. Commerce official and trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Reuters in November.     \nAdditional reporting by Jason Lange; writing by Heather Timmons; Editing by Tom Brown\n",

        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Peloton Interactive (PTON.O) tumbled over 6% on Tuesday after noted short seller Andrew Left valued the seller of stationary exercise bicycles at about one seventh of its recent stock price. \nLeft\u2019s Citron Research warned that the Peloton\u2019s bikes, priced at over $2,200, and its streaming exercise video service face competition from aggressive, cheaper rivals. It predicted Peloton\u2019s stock would fall to $5. The stock dropped $2.32 to $32.45 following the report. \nPeloton did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Citron Research report.  \nPeloton, which went public in September at $29 a share and is losing money, has filed lawsuits against Echelon Fitness LLC, alleging it infringed its patents and sold \u201ccheap, copycat\u201d products. New York-based Peloton has also filed a lawsuit against Flywheel Sports Inc, which sells its own stationary bikes with built-in tablets.  \nLeft is one of Wall Street\u2019s most prominent short sellers, and his reports in the past have hurt shares of companies including Twitter (TWTR.N), GoPro (GPRO.O), Wayfair (W.N) and ecommerce website Jumia Technologies (4JMAy.F).  \n\u201cWhile Peloton has enjoyed a first mover advantage, the lack of differentiation of its bike has finally caught up to it as the competition is not only making virtually identical exercise bikes but ones that are both more affordable and functional,\u201d Citron Research said in its report. \nBut Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, who recommends investors buy Peloton\u2019s stock, raised his price target to $38 from $29 on Tuesday, saying the company is likely to grow faster than its rivals and pointing to strong website traffic and improving customer satisfaction. \nOn the company\u2019s quarterly earnings conference call on Nov. 5, Chief Executive CEO John Paul Foley, in response to an analyst\u2019s question about competition, said: \u201cWe have a seven-year head start. We created the category. I would say, at this point, we do not have what I call like-minded competition, which would be a very well-capitalized technology company. To our knowledge, that company doesn\u2019t exist yet, but it may at some point in the coming years.\u201d \nAbout 20 analysts cover Peloton, on average rating it \u201cbuy.\u201d \nCitron Research said its $5 target price is based on a comparison with other subscription-based companies\u2019 market capitalizations per subscriber. \nWith Tuesday\u2019s decline, Peloton is down 12% from a week ago, when faced criticism for a Christmas ad some labeled as \u201csexist,\u201d and before it cut subscription prices for its video streaming service. \nThe stock remains up 12% from its IPO in September. \nReporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Leslie Adler\n",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Lawyers for Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer have won a court battle after a judge asked Canada\u2019s attorney general to hand over more evidence and documents relating to the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, according to a court ruling released on Tuesday. \nAssociate Chief Justice Heather Holmes in the Supreme Court of British Columbia agreed with Huawei Technologies Co Ltd\u2019s legal team that there is an \u201cair of reality\u201d to their assertion. \nBut she cautioned that her ruling is limited and does not address the merit of Huawei\u2019s allegations that Canadian authorities improperly handled identifying information about Meng\u2019s electronic devices. \nMeng, 47, was arrested at the Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018, at the request of the United States, where she is charged with bank fraud and accused of misleading the bank HSBC about Huawei Technologies\u2019 business in Iran. She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition. \nShe was questioned by Canadian immigration authorities prior to her arrest, and her lawyers have asked the government to hand over more documents about her arrest. \nMeng\u2019s legal team has contested her extradition in the Canadian courts on the grounds that the United States is using her extradition for economic and political gain, and that she was unlawfully detained, searched and interrogated by Canadian authorities acting on behalf of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). \nIn her ruling, Holmes wrote that she found the evidence tendered by the attorney general to have \u201cnotable gaps,\u201d citing the example of why the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) \u201cmade what is described as the simple error of turning over to the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), contrary to law, the passcodes CBSA officers had required Ms. Meng to produce.\u201d \nHolmes also said the attorney general did not provide adequate evidence to \u201crebut inferences from other evidence that the RCMP improperly sent serial numbers and other identifiers of Ms. Meng\u2019s devices to the FBI.\u201d \nHolmes said these gaps in evidence raise questions \u201cbeyond the frivolous or speculative about the chain of events,\u201d and led her to conclude that Meng\u2019s application \u201ccrosses the air of reality threshold.\u201d \nThe order does not require the disclosure of documents - the attorney general may assert a privilege, which Meng could contest in court.  \nNeither the Canadian federal justice ministry nor Huawei immediately responded to requests for comment. \nNo timeline was outlined in Holmes\u2019 ruling. \nMeng\u2019s extradition hearing will begin on Jan. 20, 2020, in a federal court in Vancouver. \nReporting by David Kirton in Shanghai and Moira Warburton in Toronto; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Matthew Lewis\n",

His testimony came on the second day of a trial that is expected to run until Dec. 20.  \nAttorneys for the states presented evidence on Tuesday from a T-Mobile board presentation in 2010, when the company first explored a deal with Sprint, that said the merger would have \u201cpotential to reduce price competition.\u201d \nH\u00f6ttges downplayed the presentation, saying it had been prepared by advisers and was not an official Deutsche Telekom document.  \nT-Mobile and Sprint have already received approval for the deal from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission, after the companies agreed to sell Sprint\u2019s prepaid phone business and some spectrum to satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp. \nThe companies argue that a stronger T-Mobile would result from the proposed takeover, making it better able to innovate and compete to reduce wireless prices. The case represents a break with the usual process of states coordinating with the federal government in reviewing mergers and generally coming to a joint conclusion. \nThe states have argued that Dish is not a viable competitor in the wireless market that could replace Sprint as the fourth-largest carrier. On Tuesday, Glenn Pomerantz, an attorney representing California in the lawsuit, asked H\u00f6ttges whether he was aware that Dish had repeatedly failed to build a network using its vast holdings of wireless spectrum.  \nH\u00f6ttges testified that Dish founder and Chairman Charlie Ergen was \u201cnot easy to deal with,\u201d but said Ergen was known for being a great entrepreneur and would have all the ingredients needed to build a network once the merger closed.  \nReporting by Sheila Dang; Editing by Noeleen Walder and Leslie Adler\n",
